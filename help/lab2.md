## Creating a view

Make sure to reference the SQL file that defines the database structure you created in Lab 1.

Copilot may not provide you with SQL that is valid for your database of choice, so if you find the SQL is invalid, reword your prompt to ask for the database server you need.

```
Create a postgresql view that shows customer orders
```

## Creating a stored procedure or function

GitHub Copilot has good general knowledge about common database engines, so you can ask it questions about the differences between stored procedures and functions.

```
What is the difference between a stored procedure and a function for postgresql?
```

Once you understand the differences you can then prompt Copilot to create the right type of artefact for you (or understand if Copilot generates a Function in place of a Stored Procedure, or vice versa).
